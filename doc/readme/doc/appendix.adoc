You will also need to do some magic in your `.htaccess` file so that `index.php` handles all requests.

[source,appache]

RewriteEngine On
# The following rule tells Apache that if the requested filename exists, simply serve it.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^.*$ - [L]

# The following rewrites all other queries to index.php. The
# condition ensures that if you are using Apache aliases to do
# mass virtual hosting or installed the project in a subdirectory,
# the base path will be prepended to allow proper resolution of
# the index.php file; it will work in non-aliased environments
# as well, providing a safe, one-size fits all solution.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$1 ^(/.+)/(.*)::\2$
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=BASE:%1]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}/index.php [L]

<Limit GET HEAD POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS>
# Deprecated apache 2.2 syntax:
# Order Allow,Deny
# Allow from all
# Apache > 2.4 requires:
Require all granted
</Limit>
